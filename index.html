            <img src="assets/images/jlvalle2.jpg" id="imgindex"/>
            <p>Passionate about music and technology, I dedicated myself mainly to the management of software development projects, 
              and it always helped me to learn new ways to create web pages, this Bootcamp Yes course represents a great challenge. 
              After all in technology you always have to keep updated, renew or die!
            </p>

            <p>I've also worked in the musical environment, but it's not like I've played music, but I've had a sound and I like to mix, 
              has put several events with an excellent musical taste, it's been like that and they've all been finished really excited.
              I love sports too, so i believe that i have a really balanced life, i enjoy my work, have time to listen to music and eventually
              going on vacation to discover new countries and cultures.
